# pathquery

pathquery aims to be an extremely small library that replaces and extends core jQuery.

pathquery encourages the use of new browsers and features without diverting too much from the jQuery flow.
It comes in at ~10 KB minified and ~4 KB gzipped, and is only compatible with the latest browsers.

## Set up

````
npm install pathquery
````

### From GitHub:
