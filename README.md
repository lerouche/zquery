# zQuery

zQuery aims to be an extremely small library that replaces and extends core jQuery.

zQuery encourages the use of new browsers and features without diverting too much from the jQuery flow.
It comes in at ~10 KB minified and ~4 KB gzipped, and is only compatible with the latest browsers.

## Set up

### From npm:

````
npm install zquery-wl
````

### From GitHub:

````
git clone https://github.com/wilsonzlin/zQuery.git
cd zQuery
node compile.js -o=/folder/to/place/compiled/js
````
